New entry function to programmatically generate files. All you have to do is add a snake-case string to the proper array!

```js
const THEME_NAME = 'starter-theme';
const THEME_DIR = `/wp-content/themes/${THEME_NAME}/src`;

function snakeToCamel(str) {
return str.replace(/([-\_][a-z])/g, (group) =>
group.toUpperCase().replace('-', '').replace('\_', ''),
);
}

/**
* For JSX folders (located `~/src/js/folder-name/App.jsx)`)
* Array of strings modeled after folder names (e.g. 'about-choctaw')
*/
const appNames = [];

/**
 * For SCSS files (no leading `_`)
 * Array of strings modeled after scss names (e.g. 'we-are-choctaw')
 */
const styleSheets = []; // for scss only

module.exports = {
	...defaultConfig,
	...{
		entry: function () {
			const entries = {
				global: `.${THEME_DIR}/index.js`,
			};
    		if (appNames.length > 0) {
    			appNames.forEach((appName) => {
    				const appNameOutput = snakeToCamel(appName);
    				entries[
    					appNameOutput
    				] = `.${THEME_DIR}/js/${appName}/App.jsx`;
    			});
    		}
    		if (styleSheets.length > 0) {
    			styleSheets.forEach((styleSheet) => {
    				const styleSheetOutput = snakeToCamel(styleSheet);
    				entries[
    					styleSheetOutput
    				] = `.${THEME_DIR}/styles/pages/${styleSheet}.scss`;
    			});
    		}
    		return entries;
    	},
    },
```
